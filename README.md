# local-blazeface

This is just continuing the Google Project Blazeface [model here](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/tfjs-model/blazeface/1/default/1) and [code for face location](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/blazeface) which was deprecated, but for some small tasks may be all you need.

The idea is for it to run in NodeJS and Browser as well.


## RUN

1. `git clone`
2. `npm i`
3. in the `src/index` add the absolute path to the image
4. run using `ts-node src/index.ts`
